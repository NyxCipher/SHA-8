SHA-8

A Futuristic Text-Based Terminal Game Centered Around Bitcoin, Conspiracy, &amp; Technology

SHA-8, a glimpse into the life of SHA-256 Bitcoin Mining Algo's, brings you into a world of Quantum Computers, Hackers, Government Conspiracy, Under-Dog Warriors, Corruptions, Control, and Power!

<b>About:</b>
<br>
Programmed in C++, SHA-8 started as nothing more than a boring night at a keyboard. After countless hours piece-mailing the Bitcoin-Core source, and the lack of time to engage in my creative writing hobby, SHA-8 was born; with a couple cups of coffee too ;)
<br><br>
SHA-8 has a basic Terminal-TextBased (CommandLine_) structure and uses a simple 'Choice/Decision' based engine. I am not looking to be UbiSoft here; HaHa! The game branches off in several tiers of story-archs and is a mix between a 'Choose-Your-Own-Ending' style book and, if I may be so bold as to say, "Zork."
<br><br>
As I do know that many people love Text-Based adventure games, most shy away from them. In response to these statistics, I have begun coding several interactive Terminal-Additions to SHA-8. These fully interactive intergrations are located in the two subdirectories: 'Transporter' and 'Hacker'

<b>Coding Notes:</b>
- The C++ base can be a bit messy at the moment
- I have added comments throughout some of the files for myself (Ie: They may be a bit difficult to comprehend)
- It's 100% A Work In Progress!!! This is just the beginning
- Please see the SHA-8 Specific README for FileStructure & Detailed Dev., Notes
