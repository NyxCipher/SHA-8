SHA-8 Mapping

Building On MinGW:
g++ sha8.cpp -o sha8.exe -fno-exceptions

-sha8.cpp : Main File
-sha8concourse.h : Starting Story Arch
-sha8.h : Freelancer Class File
-bar8.h : 2nd Tier Story Arch
-varState.h : PlaceHolder For Interactive System
-tools.h : PlaceHolder For Interactive System (2)
+ Transporter :: SubDir -> Interactive Driving Intergration
+ Hacker :: SubDir -> Interactive Comm's Hacking Intergration

Notes On C++ Style:
- Code Is Off Standards And Will Be ReWorked After Main Story Archs Are Completed
- Files Needs To Be ReOrganized For Ease-Of-Reading
- Classes Will Need An Overhaul
- Began Using std::cin >> ***; Half-Way, changed to <conio.h> // _kbhit(); |  _getch(); For Story Arch Reading
- Classes can get cumbersom on memory; Using compiler destructors ATM; Will Adjust @ 90% Completion
- std::cout << "\n\n\t"; Get's a little messy in CMD/Terminal ::: Still Needs Proofing + Spelling Corrections
- Many UnUsed portions in cClasses for now
- Avoding *pPointers && rReferances && Overloading Until I'm ready for SubDir-Intergration
- <fstream> SaveGame In Planning
- Player Profile In Planning
- Working With Boost & OpenSSL for Online Intergration For A Nice Little Surprise ;)
- I Am Only One Person

TimeLine:
- "When Its Done" <- I know, Don't Worry, It Won't Take 10-Years
- Global::User Enabled Type'd Time Delay
- Finish 12 Chapter Story Arch
- ReVamp cClasses
- CleanUp Memory Usage
[ Close Time Proximity ]
- Make Use Of *pPointers & rReferances Where Needed
- Decide On Single 'Choice Engine'
- Decide On Single Menu Display (Switch Case: Loop ATM)
- Editing & Writing Going Well
[ Not Too Distant Future : Months Away ]
- Intergrate Player Profile
- Intergrate SaveGame File
- Intergrate Transporter && Finish Transporter
- Intergrate Hacker && Finish Hacker
[ Contingent On My Other 3-Job's WorkLoads ]
- Proof Read For Spelling & Grammer
- Proof C++ Code For Standards
[ By 2015 || Just Into 2015 ]
- Beta Release
- Platform Migration
- Intergrate Boost/SSL Special
- Official Soft-Launch
- WebSite & Hard-Launch
- Marketing & Publish
- CorssPlatform Development (Linux, Android, iOS Apps)
[ I Hope To See It This Far : Mid-2015 ]

Notes On Binarys:
- In The Binarys.rar:
  - Working sha8.exe (Playable: Highly Glitchy, Unless You Can Read My Code For The Time Being)
  - Working Transporter.exe (Experimental: Issues With ASCII Art)
  - Working Hacker.exe (Compiles & Runs: Does Nothing Yet)
