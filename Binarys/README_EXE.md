Inside of Binarys.rar:

Sha8.exe

Transporter.exe

Plus: Several Development Files I Have Stored For My Own Back Up

-ArrowVar.exe -> Gives the conio.h getch && kbhit codes for interactiveOnKey Events

-OnKey -> Just a ProofOfConcept

-The Others At Pointless & Just examples of code

This *.rar is here for myself, interested friends, and people who are interested in the project. If you are trying to play the game, sha8.exe works, but is glitchy! You Should read my notes inside of the C++ to know how to run the game properly.
Please feel free to compile and play as you wish. I am a big supporter of people compiling their own code.

Contact Me:

I love hearing from people; from Suggestions, Ideas, Project Help (Yes, Please), Even Complaints. I'll teach people security or even walk you though compiling SHA-8 on windows before the Offical Beta Release Just For Fun!

If you want to play SHA-8 now and can't read code -> Send me a message and I'll explain how to play around the Developer Glitches :)
